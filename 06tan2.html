Carbon is a non-metallic element found in various forms such as graphite, diamond, and amorphous carbon. It is the basis of all life forms and a major component of many important industrial products like steel and plastics. Carbon compounds are diverse and widespread, ranging from simple gases like carbon dioxide to complex DNA and proteins.
