								<td>	
				Helium appears as a colorless, odorless, noncombustible gas. Can asphyxiate.Inhalation causes the voice to become <br/>
				squeaky (Mickey Mouse voice). Exposure of the container to prolonged heat or fire can cause it to rupture violently<br/>
				and rocket. If liquefied, contact of the very cold liquid with water causes violent boiling. Pressures may build to<br/>
				dangerous levels if the liquid contacts water in a closed container. Used in arc welding, to trace leaks in refrigeration<br/>
				and other closed systems and as a lifting gas for lighter-than-air aircraft.<br/>
