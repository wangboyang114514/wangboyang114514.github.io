                        <td>Radioactive metallic transuranic element, belongs to the actinoids. Np-237, the most stable isotope, has a half-life of 2.2*10^6 years and is a by product of nuclear reactors. The other known isotopes have mass numbers 229 through 236, and 238 through 241. Np-236 has a half-life of 5*10^3 years. First produced by Edwin M. McMillan and P.H. Abelson in 1940.</td>
